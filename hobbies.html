          <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
          <p>
            I've played dnd for around 7 years. I play twice a week on both ends
            of the table. I play as a character every Sunday and Dm every
            Thursday.

            My go to character class is a fighter or barbarian but my favorite
            class is druid. I buy a new set of dice for every character I play

          <h2>Travel</h2>
          <p>
            My wife and I love to travel. We together have been mostly local but
            we have big plans. We also got engaged on a trip to Columbia Falls,
            Montana.

            In direct contradiction I am terrified of flying and heights. I love
            to hike and be on mountains, I just won't look over the edge. I
            enjoy driving and long road trips. My goal is to go on an extended
            train ride at some point literally anywhere.

          <h2>Playing Games</h2>
          <p>
            Very related to my love of Dungeons and Dragons, I love playing all
            kinds of games. I play board games of all kinds but my favorite is
            "The Game of Life" or "Obscurio"
          </p>

            I also love video games and have been a dedicated member of that
            community for several years. I used to work as a manager for a video
            game store. Video games have also been a huge part of my life. My
            favorite games are the Borderlands series and anything Pokemon.
